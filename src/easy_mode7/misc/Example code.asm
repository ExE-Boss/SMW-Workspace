; The following code tells the game to go into Mode 7 and then uploads an interleaved tilemap.
;
; NOTE 1:	As you probably know, the SNES's VRAM contains graphics and tilemaps for the different layers.
;	They are normally separated, but in Mode 7, all even bytes are graphics-related and all odd bytes are tilemap-related (Or maybe it's the opposite I dunno :P)
;	Long story short, the VRAM constantly alternates between graphics data and tilemap data.
;	You can create this sort of tilemap with Vitor Vilela's SNESGFX program.
;	Please note that you must not use more than 256 different 8x8 tiles or things might get sorta buggy or glitchy.
; NOTE 2:	It's also recommended to actually use only 127 different colors instead of all 255 because it will overwrite sprite palettes, beginning with Mario's.
; NOTE 3:	If you're using UberASMTool, take advantage of the prot_file macro to insert your interleaved tilemap into your ROM without problems.
; NOTE 4:	This code is already SA-1 compatible as it uses direct page adressing ($XX adresses) and SNES registers ($2000+).

; === ExE Boss’s Changes ===
; I’ve modified the code so that you can create the Mode 7 graphics and tilemap separately by doing two consecutive
; DMA uploads instead, one to upload the graphics and one to upload the tilemap.
;
; This allows storing the Graphics and Tilemap seperately, making editing easier,
; since you can now use Mzuenni’s Graphics Editor (https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=15530),
; which supports the SNES 8BPP and Mode 7 formats to edit the graphics.
